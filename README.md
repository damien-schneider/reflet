## ✨ Why Reflet?

Reflet transforms chaotic feedback into actionable product insights. Build products your users actually love through transparent collaboration.

### Core Features

**📊 Feedback Management**
Collect and organize user feedback with upvoting, comments, and tags. Prioritize what matters most to your users with intuitive filtering and search.

**🗺️ Roadmap Planning**
Visualize your product roadmap with a beautiful kanban-style board. Drag-and-drop items between stages: Backlog → Planned → In Progress → Done.

**📝 Changelog & Releases**
Keep users informed with beautiful release notes. Link updates directly to the features they requested, creating a virtuous feedback loop.

**⚡ Real-Time Collaboration**
Multiple users can work simultaneously without conflicts. Every change syncs across all connected devices in milliseconds.

**👥 Team Management**
Multi-tenant architecture with organizations, team invitations, and role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Member).

**🎨 Branding & Customization**
Customize your public-facing pages with your brand colors, custom CSS, and domain.

**🔒 Flexible Privacy**
Choose what's public and what's private. Create private boards for internal discussions while keeping public feedback transparent.

**🔔 Smart Notifications**
Get notified about status changes, new comments, and vote milestones. Stay in the loop without drowning in noise.

**🔍 Powerful Search**
Full-text search across all feedback items with intelligent filtering by status, tags, and more.
