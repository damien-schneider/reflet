# Rules - instructions the AI MUST follow
# These are injected into every prompt
rules:
  - "Always use robust feature architecture with sub features and sub folders like hooks/ components/ utils/ lib/ store/ etc."
  - "The top 1 priority is the code quality"
  - "Never create files that are bigger than 350 lines of code, if you need to edit one, refactor on the way, never leave a file edited with more than 350 lines of code."
  # Examples:
  # - "Always use TypeScript strict mode"
  # - "Follow the error handling pattern in src/utils/errors.ts"
  # - "All API endpoints must have input validation with Zod"
  # - "Use server actions instead of API routes in Next.js"

# Boundaries - files/folders the AI should not modify
boundaries:
  never_touch:
    - "components/ui"
  # Examples:
  # - "src/legacy/**"
  # - "migrations/**"
  # - "*.lock"
