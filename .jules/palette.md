## 2025-02-19 - Password Visibility Toggle
**Learning:** Users often struggle with password complexity requirements, leading to frustration when typos occur in masked fields. Adding a toggle to reveal the password allows users to verify their input before submission, reducing error rates and improving accessibility for users with cognitive or motor impairments.
**Action:** Always include a "Show/Hide" toggle on password inputs, ensuring it is keyboard accessible and has proper ARIA labels state (e.g., "Show password" vs "Hide password").
