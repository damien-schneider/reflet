## 2025-02-18 - SSR-Safe HTML Sanitization
**Vulnerability:** Stored XSS in changelog descriptions rendered via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
**Learning:** The application uses SSR (via Next.js), so standard `dompurify` fails because it requires a browser environment (DOM) which is missing on the server.
**Prevention:** Use `isomorphic-dompurify` instead of `dompurify` to ensure sanitization works correctly in both server and client environments without crashing the build or runtime.
