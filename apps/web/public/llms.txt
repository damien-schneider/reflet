# Reflet

> A modern product feedback and roadmap platform that helps you collect feedback, prioritize features, and keep your users in the loop.

## Overview

Reflet transforms chaotic feedback into actionable product insights. Build products your users actually love through transparent collaboration.

## Core Features

### Feedback Management
Collect and organize user feedback with upvoting, comments, and tags. Prioritize what matters most to your users with intuitive filtering and search.

### Roadmap Planning
Visualize your product roadmap with a beautiful kanban-style board. Drag-and-drop items between stages: Backlog → Planned → In Progress → Done.

### Changelog & Releases
Keep users informed with beautiful release notes. Link updates directly to the features they requested, creating a virtuous feedback loop.

### Real-Time Collaboration
Multiple users can work simultaneously without conflicts. Every change syncs across all connected devices in milliseconds.

### Team Management
Multi-tenant architecture with organizations, team invitations, and role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Member).

### Branding & Customization
Customize your public-facing pages with your brand colors, custom CSS, and domain.

### Flexible Privacy
Choose what's public and what's private. Create private boards for internal discussions while keeping public feedback transparent.

### Smart Notifications
Get notified about status changes, new comments, and vote milestones. Stay in the loop without drowning in noise.

Full-text search across all feedback items with intelligent filtering by status, tags, and more.
